                                After graudation, I accpeted (was told!) a job at the Space and Missile Systems Center (now renamed Space Systems Center or SSC) located in El Segundo, 
                                California. At SSC I was the porject officer for a next-generation SATCOM program for all three years. For the first 1.5 years, I was part of a team 
                                responsible for wokring the satellite portion of the ecosystem. I was then transitioned to a terminal modem program for the same SATCOM ecosystem. From the 
                                modem program I was shifted to a role at the renowned Kessel Run program office, where I am still currently working. In January 2024 I am planning to 
                                transition into the civilian work force, with the goal of becoming a software engineer after realizing program/product management wasn't my strong suit!

                                            am more interested in back end programming than front end right now!</p>

                                            and was always look for an advatage!</p>

                                                been on the search from a new online CO-OP campaign game, similar to the Borderlands franchise.</p>

                                    <p>My last hobby is cars. I enjoy any good, enthusiast car but have a personal bias toward BMW M cars or any car that has a manual transmission. A
                                        manual transmission makes a simple drive to the grocery store feel like so much more. You feel more connected to the car, and downshifting through 
                                        the gears can make it feel like you're coming up to the Corkscrew at Laguna Seca!</p>
