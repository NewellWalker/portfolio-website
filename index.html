                            I graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 2019 with a BS in Management. I then received my Certified Strenght and Conditioning Specialist 
                            (CSCS) certification from the Nation Strength and Conitioning Association. Currently, I am working toward various Codecademy certifications including

                            The Full Stack Engineering course includes HTML, CSS, Git/Github comptency, Javascript, React, SQL, and much more! I have previously completed multitple
                            Python course as an intro into programming!

                            After graudation, I accpeted (was told!) a job at the Space and Missile Systems Center (now renamed Space Systems Center or SSC) located in El Segundo, 
                            California. At SSC I was the porject officer for a next-generation SATCOM program for all three years. For the first 1.5 years, I was part of a team 
                            responsible for wokring the satellite portion of the ecosystem. I was then transitioned to a terminal modem program for the same SATCOM ecosystem. From the 
                            modem program I was shifted to a role at the renowned Kessel Run program office, where I am still currently working. In January 2024 I am planning to 
                            transition into the civilian work force, with the goal of becoming a software engineer after realizing program/product management wasn't my strong suit!

                                    <p>With my current job being full-time, learning to program is done after normal business hours. I
                                        am more interested in back end programming than front end right now!</p>

                                    <p>Lifting weight and incorporating proper nutrition is on of my passions. Learning about what can help improve our health/performance has always been an interest of mine, probably because I grew with an older brother
                                        and was always look for an advatage!</p>

                                        <p>I enjoy anything from racing games to FPS to RPGs, I just enjoy a well put together game mechanics meshed with a solid story. I've
                                            been on the search from a new online CO-OP campaign game, similar to the Borderlands franchise.</p>

                                <p>My last hobby is cars. I enjoy any good, enthusiast car but have a personal bias toward BMW M cars or any car that has a manual transmission. A
                                    manual transmission makes a simple drive to the grocery store feel like so much more. You feel more connected to the car, and downshifting through 
                                    the gears can make it feel like you going through the Corkscrew at Laguna Seca!</p>
